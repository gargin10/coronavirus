            <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</p>
            <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                recover
                without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
                cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop
                serious
                illness.</p>
            <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
                disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands
                or
                using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an
                infected
                person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example,
                by
                coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="symptoms">
            <h1>SYMPTOMS</h1>
            <p>COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate
                illness and recover without hospitalization.</p>
            <p>Most common symptoms:
            <ul>
                <li>fever.</li>
                <li>dry cough.</li>
                <li>tiredness.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Less common symptoms:
            <ul>
                <li>aches and pains.</li>
                <li>sore throat.</li>
                <li>diarrhoea.</li>
                <li>conjunctivitis.</li>
                <li>headache.</li>
                <li>loss of taste or smell.</li>
                <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Serious symptoms:
            <ul>
                <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</li>
                <li>chest pain or pressure.</li>
                <li>loss of speech or movement.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however
                it
                can take up to 14 days. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="prevention">
            <h1>PREVENTION</h1>
            <p>To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
                <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
                <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs</li>
                <li>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of
                    people.</li>
            </ul>
